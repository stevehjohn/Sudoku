# Observations

- Find a hidden single, skip FindLowestValue.
- If Last, explore others before coming back. Solutions seem to always be a run of singles and guesses.

# Other Notes

- Good for visualising branches: ........1..58.3...4............2......6.1.....7....98.2..1....4.1..5...63....4...
- Could add naked pair removals to the ConsoleSolveVisualiser.
