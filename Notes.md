# Observations

- Find a hidden single, skip FindLowestValue.
- If Last, explore others before coming back. Solutions seem to always be a run of singles and guesses.

# Other Notes

- Good for visualising branches: 1.849.....9.............7......3....62.....4....85..1....1....6.7.....93..5......
- Could add naked pair removals to the ConsoleSolveVisualiser.
